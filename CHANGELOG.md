## 0.1 - Analyze and visualize data model

Can view and arrange MySQL schema to ensure that it parsed properly.

- As a schema annotator, I want to upload a mysql schema for parsing so that I can view and annotate entities and relationships in my data model.
- As a schema viewer, I want to see the entity relationships in a schema displayed as a force directed graph so that I can visualize the data model.
- As a schema viewer, I want to collapse and uncollapse entities so that I can read the annotations and see the attributes and data types.
- As a schema viewer I want to see which attributes are primary keys and foreign keys so I can better understand how the entities relate to each other.
- As a schema annotator, I want to load a mysql schema by url for parsing so that I can view and annotate entities and relationships on a schema available online.
